This repository is intended as a collection of classic arcade games rendered in Python. 

-------------------------------------------------
Pong

The classic ping-pong rendition, with two simple but elegant paddles bouncing a ball to each other. All in one file and with on-board Python tools.

To adjust the speed with which the ball flies across the screen, define the "speed" variable; to adjust the number of points needed to win and end the game, adjust the "ending_score" variable. Both are defined at the outset of the file.

The code is based on practice assignments from Angela Yu's (highly recommendable!) online Python course "100 Days of Code", but has numerous deviations and modifications compared to the code presented by Angela as a solution to the assignments. I leave it to you to decide whether they constitute an improvement.
