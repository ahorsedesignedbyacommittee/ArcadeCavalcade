This repository is intended as a collection of classic arcade games rendered in Python. 

-------------------------------------------------
Pong

The classic ping-pong rendition, with two simple but elegant paddles bouncing a ball to each other. All in one file and with on-board Python tools.

To adjust the speed with which the ball flies across the screen, define the "speed" variable; to adjust the number of points needed to win and end the game, adjust the "ending_score" variable. Both are defined at the outset of the file.
